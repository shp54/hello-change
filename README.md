This program simulates a cash register and allows the user to ask if there is change for any integer amount in the register.

There are four commands this program accepts:

put - This takes five arguments - the number of $20, $10, $5, $2, and $1 bills the user wishes to put in the register. If valid arguments are provided, the program will add the given amount to the register.

take - This takes five arguments - the number of $20, $10, $5, $2, and $1 bills the user wishes to take out of the register. If valid arguments are provided, the program will subtract the given amount from the register.

change - This takes one argument - the amount of that user wishes to get in change. If the right amount of change exists, the program will automatically take the change from the register. Otherwise, it will display an error message.

quit - This exits the program.
